<h1>Pancakes</h1>
<p>
    <small>2020-04-15</small>
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>2 cups all purpose | plain flour</li>
<li>1/4 cup granulated sugar or sweetener</li>
<li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups milk (plus up to 1/4 cup extra if needed)</li>
<li>1/4 cup butter , melted</li>
<li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>

<p>Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large-sized bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg.
Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before slowly folding them into the dry ingredients. Mix together until smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay).
(The batter will be thick and creamy in consistency. If you find the batter too thick -- doesn't pour off the ladle or out of the measuring cup smoothly -- fold a couple tablespoons of extra milk into the batter at a time until reaching desired consistency).
Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle. 
Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease pan. Pour Â¼ cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup.
When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.</p>

<p>Serve with honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream or frozen yoghurt, or enjoy plain!</p>
